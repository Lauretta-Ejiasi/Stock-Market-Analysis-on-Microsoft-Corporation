Microsoft Stock Market Analysis Dashboard

hrilled to share insights from my latest Tableau project, focusing on the Stock Market Analysis of Microsoft Corporation spanning from 1986 to 2022.

Using Tableau's dynamic visualization capabilities, I examined Microsoft's stock performance data, unearthing valuable insights for investors and enthusiasts alike.

One of the highlights is utilizing line charts that illustrate stock volume trends by year, providing a bird 's-eye view of trading activity throughout the decades and pinpointing periods of heightened market interest.

Additionally, I explored quarterly fluctuations in average open and close prices, offering nuanced insights into Microsoft's stock price dynamics within each quarter and aiding in strategic decision-making for investors.

As I progressed with the analysis, I examined average high and low prices by year using visually engaging visualizations. This allowed me to uncover patterns in price volatility and identify significant milestones in Microsoft's stock history.

Finally, I performed an in-depth analysis of average adjusted close and close prices by year, providing a holistic view of Microsoft's stock performance while accounting for factors like dividends and stock splits. These insights offer a comprehensive understanding of Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory and financial resilience.

Through interactive dashboards and captivating visuals, this project aims to empower investors with actionable insights and foster a deeper comprehension of Microsoft's journey in the stock market.
